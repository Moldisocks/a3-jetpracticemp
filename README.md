## JetPracticeMP Summary

ARMA 3 mission designed to allow players to easily spawn into jets, customise their loadouts, destroy enemy AI vehicles (ground & air), and compete against other players with air-to-air matchmaking.

Multiplayer mission only, up to 8 players, but more can be added easily.

All settings, loadouts and achivements are stored locally on the player. If you delete your profile or it is otherwise lost, you will loose these settings and your progression.
