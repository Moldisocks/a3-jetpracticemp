## JetPracticeMP Summary

ARMA 3 mission, designed to allow players to easily spawn into jets, customise their loadouts and destroy enemy ground and air targets.

Multiplayer mission only, up to 4 players, but more can be added easily.

All settings, loadouts and points are stored locally on the player. If you delete your profile or it is otherwise lost, you will loose these settings and your progression.
