# Description:
Virtual Vehicle Spawner (VVS) is what the title says. It is similar to Virtual Ammobox System (VAS) but this allows you to spawn in vehicles with a simple to use GUI menu. VVS is something that a lot of Armory missions could benefit from and possibly other missions. This was requested by quite a bit of people and after chucking what I did 3 weeks ago I did this in 4 hours.
